# 2048 Game

This is a Python implementation of the popular **2048 game**, where you slide tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine them and reach the tile **2048**.

## How to Play
- Run the program in a Python environment (requires Python 3.x).
- Use the following keys to move the tiles:
  - `W`: Move Up
  - `A`: Move Left
  - `S`: Move Down
  - `D`: Move Right
- Combine tiles with the same number to create a new tile with their sum.
- A new tile (2 or 4) will appear after every valid move.

## Goal
- The objective is to create a tile with the value **2048**.
- The game ends when no valid moves are possible.

## Enjoy the Game!
